## Introduction
This project is a skeleton SSL server application developed as a part of CS-305 coursework. It is built using Spring Boot and Maven, and is designed to demonstrate a simple SSL server implementation. The original package name `com.snhu.ssl-server` was found to be invalid, so it has been changed to `com.snhu.sslserver`.
